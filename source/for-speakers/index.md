Thanks for speaking at CampJS! We couldn't do this without you!

## Your talk

Talks run for _20 minutes_, with up to 10 mins of questions during changeover should you wish. It's totally okay to not have questions, or to take the q&a offline to another location if you'd prefer.

Your talk will be [scheduled on the schedule](/schedule/) page. Each talk will be announced in the main hall prior to starting, but please make sure you're at the venue at least 10 minutes prior to your talk starting so we can set you up.

If you'd like to test the A/V equipment beforehand, feel free to ask one of the [organizers](/organisers).

## Preparation

Some notes to consider when preparing your talk:

1.  **Ensure your presentation conforms with the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)**
1.  Watch out putting content close to the edge (projectors sometimes cut off the edges / top / bottom)
1.  Use text that is large enough to read from a distance (e.g. 18 pt or larger)
1.  Some colors may not show up well on the projector as there can be poor contrast during the day. White on black will be more legible than black on white.
1.  Also consider people who are colorblind when selecting colors for slides.
1.  Internet access will be unreliable at camp so please pre-record demos involving network access (e.g. take screenshots / video)
1.  Consider checking your slides with [SlideLint](http://slidelint.net/) to avoid common pitfalls

## Some contacts

If you want to discuss _anything_ or need help in any way, get in touch with one of the [organizers](/organisers).
