      sessionTitle: Your web page never listens to me
      synopsis: >
        <p>Siri, Alexa, Cortana and “Hey Google” - the big companies are all building services that can talk to us, and that we can talk back to. These are great for setting timers, adding reminders, playing a song, but compared to the sheer amount of information and interaction available to us on the web, they’re quite limited.</p>
        <p>Have you wanted to include speech driven interfaces in the pages or apps you build? Did you know there are well supported web standards for teaching your page to talk? And there are emerging standards for the harder job of teaching your app to listen?</p>
        <p>Let’s explore the possibilities of combining voice with the natural strengths of the web platform, see how speech driven interfaces can help us move to a more accessible and inclusive web.</p>

      sessionTitle: Build Your Own Compiler
      synopsis: >
        <p>"Compilers" are usually-mysterious things that a lot of us actually use and rely on from day to day, eg. the JavaScript V8 engine+compiler (that Node.js and Google Chrome use to run JavaScript), or the TypeScript compiler. Some parts of compilers can appear in other tools too, such as linters and code formatters.</p>
        <p>Digging into how these work can be satisfying in of itself, like sleuthing a good puzzle, but some of the ways we implement them can appear in other forms, such as when validating user input or writing a wrapper library.</p>
        <p>This session will be kicked off by a quick talk that introduces the main parts of a compiler, followed by a "Stream Adventure"-style guided workshop through building a little compiler of your own</p>
