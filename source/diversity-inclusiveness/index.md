We value the diversity and inclusion of under-represented and marginalized people in tech.

CampJS is a friendly and welcoming environment and <a href="/code-of-conduct">does not tolerate discrimination or harrassment of any kind</a>.

## Accessibility

## Diversity initiatives
This year we've spoken to the community and have a number of diversity initiatives to make CampJS a more welcoming place.

* Diversity tickets for underrepresented groups
* First-timer discount so newbies have a better opportunity to attend
* More to come, watch this space
