CampJS IX will be held at <a href='http://koonjewarre.com'>Koonjewarre Camp, Queensland, Australia</a> (<a href='https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Koonjewarre/@-28.228613,153.270401,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb1b3c5350f23cbd2!8m2!3d-28.228613!4d153.270401'>map</a>). The venue is about 1.5hrs drive from Brisbane CBD, Gold Coast Hinterland.


The accommodation at Koonjewarre is dormitory style with around 12 beds per dorm, and shared showers and toilets per dorm. You will need to bring your own toiletries.

Bunks with mattresses are provided, but you will need to bring your own pillow, sleeping bag and linen.

The bulk of our accommodation is gender neutral, but we have other more specific options if you'd prefer:

## Womens dorms
The camp has dedicated accommodation for women, each with a separate bathroom and common room. You may also choose to bunk in the regular dorms should you wish.

Bathrooms in the common areas of the camp are non gendered and attendees are supported in using the accommodation and bathroom options that they are comfortable with.

CampJS is committed to providing an inclusive and safe environment for all so please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you have any questions about facilities and accommodation.

## Families

Families & children are always welcome at CampJS.

Limited numbers of private rooms are available for families to share, or you might choose to stay at alternative accommodation nearby.

If you are bringing your family to stay in CampJS accomodation, please email <a href='mailto:organisers-team@campjs.com'>organisers [hyphen] team [at] campjs [dot] com</a> with details around how many adults and children will be in your family, if you require childcare and any other requirements you may have.

Depending on space & ticket sales, families still might have to share a room with other families.

## Bringing a tent
If you're the more adventurous type, there is space for setting up tents to camp on the Koonjewarre grounds.

You will need to bring your own tent and camping equipment. Shower and bathroom facilities can be found in the main compound, a short walk away.

## Alternative Accommodation

Springbrook is a popular holiday spot so there are several alternative accommodation options nearby. If you would prefer to stay offsite, check the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/accommodation/@-28.224356,153.269553,16z">Google Maps results for accommodation nearby</a>.
